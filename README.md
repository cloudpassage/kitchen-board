Ruby console with a CloudPassage api session going

Setup:

Following "best practices" you should configure three ENV variables for your account
the values are generated by cloupdassage admin for a particular user

so you can either set this up somehwere as

```
export HALO_CLIENTID = 'xxxxx'
export HALO_CLIENTSECRET  = 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'
export HALO_HOST = 'api.cloudpassage.com'
```

launch locally as :

`ruby halo_console.rb`


How To Use:

Running `halo_console.rb` will create a `cp` object with the API session token embedded so you can just fire requests
The responses are shown by default in their json format, but can be modified with `jpp` pretty print
for json, or `to_hash` to get into a Ruby hash format


Things you can try:


cp.get(:fim_policies)

cp.get(:groups).jpp

cp.get "fim_policies/put_an_id_in_here"

For PUT and POST actions, parameters can be supplied as a Hash,
this will be handled by RestClient and submitted the right way

For example:

cp.post "fim_policies", my_hash_policy
