Ruby console with a CloudPassage api session going


####Requirements and Dependencies
run bundle install

json, rest-client, oauth2 and awesome_print g

####Installation 

clone the git repo, 


####Configuration

Following "best practices" you should configure three ENV variables for your account
the values are generated by cloupdassage admin for a particular user

so you can either set this up somehwere as

```
export HALO_KEY_ID = 'xxxxx'
export HALO_SECRET_KEY  = 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'
export HALO_HOST = 'api.cloudpassage.com'
```

launch locally as :

`./halo_console.rb`

if all is set up correctly you will see the following prompt

CloudPassage API Ruby Command Line Interface
********************************************
 Now you can call cp.get and so on 
#<CpSession:<object hash>

2.0.0p195 :001 >` 


####Usage

Running `halo_console.rb` will create a `cp` object with the API session token embedded so you can just fire requests
The responses are shown by default in their json format, but can be modified with `jpp` pretty print
for json, or `to_hash` to get into a Ruby hash format


#####*Example Commands*

cp.get(:fim_policies)

cp.get(:groups).jpp

cp.get "fim_policies/put_an_id_in_here"

For PUT and POST actions, parameters can be supplied as a JSON,
this will be handled by RestClient and submitted the right way

For example:

given a file integrity policy "file.json" you could execute

my_json_policy = File.read("file.json")

cp.post "fim_policies", my_json_policy


#####* Output*

a response object that is by default showing the json version, but can be made into a Ruby Hash by the .to_hash method
