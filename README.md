Ruby console with a CloudPassage api session going

Setup:

Following "best practices" you should configure three ENV variables for your account
the values are generated by cloupdassage admin for a particular user

so you can either set this up somehwere as
export CLIENTID = 'xxxxx'
export CLIENTSECRET  = 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'
export HOST = 'api.cloudpassage.com'

launch locally as :

ruby cp_console.rb


How To Use:

Running the cp_console.rb will create a cp object with the API session token embedded so you can just fire requests
The responses are shown by default in their json format, but can be modified with "jpp" pretty print
for json, or "to_hash" to get into a Ruby hash format


Things you can try:

cp.get(:fim_policies)

cp.get(:groups).jpp

cp.get "fim_policies/put_an_id_in_here"

For put and post actions, parameters can be supplied as a Hash,
 this will be handled by RestClient and submitted the right wat

like:

cp.post "fim_policies", my_hash_policy
